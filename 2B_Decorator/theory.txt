When?
    when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects

How to implememt?
    1.  Define an interface with common method across all the structs
    2.  Define a base struct with its attributes and define methods present in interface for base class
    3.  Create structs for each addOns and each struct will have methods (step 1) defined
    4.  All the base structs and addOns will have interface as an attrubute
    5.  In main(), start with a base struct and assign an addOn object to interface attribute.

    main() will look something like this
    a := baseClass {
        interfaceVar: &addOn1 {
            interfaceVar: &add0n2 {
                interfaceVar: &addOn3{}
            }
        }
    }
