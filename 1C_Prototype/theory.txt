When?
    When you have to create a lots of very similar objects where youâ€™ve some default data to be added while creating those objects

How to implement:
    1.  Create a Prototype interface with a clone() method in interface
    2.  Create a main struct with different setter and a clone() method.
    3.  Create a map to store different category of object(key: category of an object, value: object itself), with default data of that category being set
    4.  Clone() method of main struct will return a copy of object
    5.  New instance will call clone() thru type of an object stored in registry
    6.  Set values (non default) for new instance
