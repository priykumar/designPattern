When to use Builder?
    1.  When multiple representation of same product need to be designed, like igloo house and normal house
    2.  When too many attributes in main class
    3.  When you need to validate incoming attribute values before creating an object

Implemetation steps:
    1.  Declare common contruction steps/methods to build a product, in an interface.
    2.  Create main class with all the required attributes.
    3.  Create builder classes and implement setter methods(methods declared in interface (point 1))
    4.  Implememt a method to fetch the resultn(getHouse()). This method may/may not be decalared in the interface.
    5.  Create a director class, with builder interface as its attribute
    6.  Define method for director to set builders and method to sequentially call all the construction methods declared in interface
    7.  Client code or main() creates builder and director object and the call director method to get the final product
